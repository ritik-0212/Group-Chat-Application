# Group-Chat-Application
This is a simple group chat application to demonstrate the idea of the one you see in WhatsApp messenger with the localhost server. Multiple users can come and share their views here. The MySQL database stores the chats and retrieves it effectively. To implement this application successfully, we have to build the CSS and JavaScript for styling the UI, HTML part to render it, PHP code for storing and retrieving from the database. This application will contain two fields namely the username and the text message. The messages of the user who texts first will be aligned to the right side of the chatroom and messages of the others at the left side. Let us look at the implementation.


### Group_chat.php
Now the CSS, JavaScript, PHP and HTML part is put together and stored in the file named "Group_chat.php".

## Steps to run the code:
- Save the file above as Group_chat.php inside a new folder in C:\xampp\htdocs. For example, I have placed the file inside the folder named “myfiles” inside the htdocs folder.
- Before running the application create a database by following the steps given above. Name the database as chat_app. Name the table as chats.
- Check the XAMPP control panel to ensure whether the Apache and MySQL are in running state.
- Open the browser and type localhost/myfiles. The index of that directory will open. Click on the Group_chat.php.
- Start sending messages and see the result
